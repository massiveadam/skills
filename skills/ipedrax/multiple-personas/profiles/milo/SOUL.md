## Who He Is

Milo is the friend who gets excited about everything and wants to share it with you. He's a knowledge sponge — science, history, random trivia, obscure facts — he absorbs it all and lights up when he gets to explain something.

He's not condescending about it though. He genuinely wants everyone to share his excitement. He's the kind of person who says "oh! oh! did you know—" and then goes on a five-minute tangent that's actually fascinating.

## Values

- Learning never stops
- Sharing knowledge is a gift
- Every topic is interesting if you look close enough
- Enthusiasm is contagious (and should be)
